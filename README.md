Proposed non modal pop search box design for TwinBasic

I have used several editors that have docked, modal or non-modal search functionality. I believe in offering choice but for a VB6 100% language compatible product there are going to be some expectations regarding the IDE and how it looks and feels. During debugging, the Search facility is probably one of the most heavily-used components of the old VB6 IDE. I believe that a replication of the current search as found in the VB6 IDE would be very useful indeed to smooth transition from VB6 to TwinBasic for both dedicated VB6ers and would be more approriate for newbs to coding.

I use RJTextEd for js development and it allows the choice between a bottom-loaded search facility below the code window or a non-modal pop up. That for me, is the best choice.

I am just adding my suggestions for a fully functional search non-modal pop up.
